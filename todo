Need a way to remove domains.
Ask for password on save.
Display errors with rustbox.
Show some sort of UI even if there are no domains.
Nice boxes like with that go dashboard library?
Enter obnoxious password in order to save
	- only if something is unblocked?
Save changes on demand, not just exit?
